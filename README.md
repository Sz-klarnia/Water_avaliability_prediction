# Prediction of water avaliability using LSTMs

Disclaimer: all notebooks in this repository are based on data from this kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/acea-water-prediction/overview. I found the problem interesting and wanted to show my work in this GitHub portfolio. To comply with the rules I do no share data provided to competitors. If You're interested in data please refer to kaggle competition at the link.

# Description

Maintaining water supplies at sufficient levels is a key issue, as water is an essential resource for humans. Water companies need to predict levels to manage and conserve water efficiently. Water consumption can grow with climate warming, and it's supply may decline.   
In the notebook Aquifier_Auser I present an analysis of climate conditions and a predicting model based on LSTM neural network for forecasting water levels in this supply.
